 🤖 Anonymous Telegram Message Bot

This Telegram bot allows users to send 'anonymous messages' directly to the bot owner.
The sender does not need to know the admin’s Telegram account — all communication happens through the bot.


 📝 How It Works

1. A user opens the bot and presses /start
2. The user sends any text message
3. The bot forwards the message to the admin
4. The user receives a confirmation that the message was delivered

The admin receives all incoming messages privately.
